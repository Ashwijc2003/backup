Great! Since your phone is now streaming video at http://192.168.0.105:8080, you can grab that stream directly in your Raspberry Pi using Python + OpenCV.

‚úÖ Getting Phone Camera Stream into Raspberry Pi

Here‚Äôs a minimal Python script to test the live stream from your phone:

üêç Step 1: Test Stream on Raspberry Pi

Create a file called stream_test.py:

import cv2

# Replace with your actual stream URL
url = 'http://192.168.0.105:8080/video'

cap = cv2.VideoCapture(url)

while True:
    ret, frame = cap.read()
    if not ret:
        print("Failed to grab frame")
        break

    cv2.imshow("Phone Camera Stream", frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) == ord('q'):
        break

cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Step 2: Run the Script

python3 stream_test.py

> This should open a window on your Pi (if you are on desktop) showing the live stream from your phone camera.

üõ†Ô∏è Headless Mode (No GUI / SSH Users)

If you're using Raspberry Pi headless (no monitor, just SSH), and want to process frames without showing them:

Just comment out or remove:

cv2.imshow("Phone Camera Stream", frame)

And remove or comment:

cv2.waitKey(1)

Would you like me to now add basic object (e.g., red color) detection + GPIO trigger to this stream-reading code?
