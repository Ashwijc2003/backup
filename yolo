sudo python3 detect.py --source http://192.168.0.105:8080/video --weights yolov5n.pt --conf 0.5
You're almost there! The error you're seeing is because Debian Bookworm (your Raspberry Pi OS version) doesn't allow direct pip3 install into the system-wide Python environment by default.


---

‚úÖ Here's how to fix it quickly:

üõ†Ô∏è Use a virtual environment ‚Äî this is the clean and safe method

Run these commands inside your ~/yolov5 folder:

# Step 1: Install the venv package if not already
sudo apt install python3-venv -y

# Step 2: Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv yolov5-env

# Step 3: Activate the virtual environment
source yolov5-env/bin/activate

# Step 4: Now install the requirements safely inside the venv
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

Now you're inside an isolated Python environment and can run YOLOv5 safely.


---

üöÄ Run Detection After Setup:

Once the install is done and you're still inside the venv, run:

python detect.py --source http://192.168.0.105:8080/video --weights yolov5n.pt --conf 0.5


---

‚ùó If You Exit or Reboot:

Next time, just do:

cd ~/yolov5
source yolov5-env/bin/activate
python detect.py --source http://192.168.0.105:8080/video --weights yolov5n.pt --conf 0.5

Let me know once you're done with this ‚Äî I‚Äôll help with GPIO next or help reduce delay.

    If you wish to install a non-Debian-packaged Python package,
    create a virtual environment using python3 -m venv path/to/venv.

‚úÖ YOLOv5 on GitHub

The main repository is fully available and up‚Äëto‚Äëdate:

ultralytics/yolov5 ‚Äî Official YOLOv5 code with model definitions, examples, and the detect.py script  


You‚Äôll find everything needed to clone, install, and run detection from live streams.


---

üìò Quickstart Guide

The quickstart instructions show how to get everything running fast:

1. Clone repository


2. Install dependencies


3. Run detect.py with your camera source  :



git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 detect.py --source http://<your-phone-ip>:8080/video --weights yolov5n.pt --conf 0.5

It's straightforward, and your object will be tracked live with bounding boxes.


---

üîç Confirmation

The presence of the detect.py script, the README, and pip-installable models confirm the repo‚Äôs integrity and availability  


---

‚úÖ What You Should Do Next

Run those commands above on your Pi (or laptop if Pi is too slow).

Use --source to point to your phone‚Äôs stream.

Test with your drone as it flies.


Let me know once you've cloned and tested it‚Äîwe'll build motion/LED trigger integration after that!
