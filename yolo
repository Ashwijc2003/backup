Yes—the GitHub link is absolutely working. You can access the official YOLOv5 repository and docs as follows:


---

✅ YOLOv5 on GitHub

The main repository is fully available and up‑to‑date:

ultralytics/yolov5 — Official YOLOv5 code with model definitions, examples, and the detect.py script  


You’ll find everything needed to clone, install, and run detection from live streams.


---

📘 Quickstart Guide

The quickstart instructions show how to get everything running fast:

1. Clone repository


2. Install dependencies


3. Run detect.py with your camera source  :



git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 detect.py --source http://<your-phone-ip>:8080/video --weights yolov5n.pt --conf 0.5

It's straightforward, and your object will be tracked live with bounding boxes.

🔍 Confirmation

The presence of the detect.py script, the README, and pip-installable models confirm the repo’s integrity and availability  


---

✅ What You Should Do Next

Run those commands above on your Pi (or laptop if Pi is too slow).

Use --source to point to your phone’s stream.

Test with your drone as it flies.


Let me know once you've cloned and tested it—we'll build motion/LED trigger integration after that!
