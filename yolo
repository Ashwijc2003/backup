Yes, üíØ ‚Äî you can install everything needed for YOLOv5 (including PyTorch) on your Raspberry Pi 3 in a single block of code.

Here‚Äôs a complete copy-paste script that:

1. Sets up a virtual environment


2. Installs dependencies


3. Downloads & installs PyTorch for ARM


4. Verifies everything is ready

‚úÖ One-Block Setup Script for YOLOv5 on Raspberry Pi 3

> üí° Paste this into your terminal as a single block (it handles everything).



sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y python3-pip python3-venv libopenblas-dev libblas-dev libatlas-base-dev libjpeg-dev libpng-dev libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libgtk2.0-dev libgtk-3-dev

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv yolov5-env
source yolov5-env/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip and tools
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

# Install core dependencies
pip install numpy matplotlib opencv-python

# Download and install PyTorch for Raspberry Pi 3 (ARMv7, Python 3.9)
wget https://github.com/nmilosev/pytorch-arm-builds/releases/download/v1.12.0/torch-1.12.0-cp39-none-linux_armv7l.whl
pip install torch-1.12.0-cp39-none-linux_armv7l.whl

# Optional: Verify torch installed correctly
python3 -c "import torch; print('‚úÖ PyTorch Version:', torch.__version__)"

# Clone YOLOv5 (if not done)
git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
cd yolov5

# Install YOLOv5 requirements (some might already be installed)
pip install -r requirements.txt


---

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure:

You are using Python 3.9 (check with python3 --version)

You‚Äôre on a Raspberry Pi 3, running Raspberry Pi OS Bookworm or Bullseye



---

After this, you can run:

sudo python3 detect.py --source http://192.168.0.105:8080/video --weights yolov5n.pt --conf 0.5

And GPIO should also work if you‚Äôve added the code!


---

Let me know if you want to turn GPIO high for specific objects only like 'drone', 'airplane', or 'bird', or if you want to run it headless (without monitor) in your college demo.











sudo python3 detect.py --source http://192.168.0.105:8080/video --weights yolov5n.pt --conf 0.5
You're almost there! The error you're seeing is because Debian Bookworm (your Raspberry Pi OS version) doesn't allow direct pip3 install into the system-wide Python environment by default.
udo python3 detect.py --source http://192.168.0.105:8080/video --weights yolov5n.pt --conf 0.5
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/ashwin/yolov5/detect.py", line 41, in <module>
    import torch
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'torch'

 

---

‚úÖ Here's how to fix it quickly:

üõ†Ô∏è Use a virtual environment ‚Äî this is the clean and safe method

Run these commands inside your ~/yolov5 folder:

# Step 1: Install the venv package if not already
sudo apt install python3-venv -y

# Step 2: Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv yolov5-env

# Step 3: Activate the virtual environment
source yolov5-env/bin/activate

# Step 4: Now install the requirements safely inside the venv
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

Now you're inside an isolated Python environment and can run YOLOv5 safely.


---

üöÄ Run Detection After Setup:

Once the install is done and you're still inside the venv, run:

python detect.py --source http://192.168.0.105:8080/video --weights yolov5n.pt --conf 0.5


---

‚ùó If You Exit or Reboot:

Next time, just do:

cd ~/yolov5
source yolov5-env/bin/activate
python detect.py --source http://192.168.0.105:8080/video --weights yolov5n.pt --conf 0.5

Let me know once you're done with this ‚Äî I‚Äôll help with GPIO next or help reduce delay.

‚úÖ YOLOv5 on GitHub

The main repository is fully available and up‚Äëto‚Äëdate:

ultralytics/yolov5 ‚Äî Official YOLOv5 code with model definitions, examples, and the detect.py script  


You‚Äôll find everything needed to clone, install, and run detection from live streams.


---

üìò Quickstart Guide

The quickstart instructions show how to get everything running fast:

1. Clone repository


2. Install dependencies


3. Run detect.py with your camera source  :



git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 detect.py --source http://<your-phone-ip>:8080/video --weights yolov5n.pt --conf 0.5

It's straightforward, and your object will be tracked live with bounding boxes.


---

üîç Confirmation

The presence of the detect.py script, the README, and pip-installable models confirm the repo‚Äôs integrity and availability  


---

‚úÖ What You Should Do Next

Run those commands above on your Pi (or laptop if Pi is too slow).

Use --source to point to your phone‚Äôs stream.

Test with your drone as it flies.


Let me know once you've cloned and tested it‚Äîwe'll build motion/LED trigger integration after that!
