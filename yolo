‚úÖ YOLOv5 on GitHub

The main repository is fully available and up‚Äëto‚Äëdate:

ultralytics/yolov5 ‚Äî Official YOLOv5 code with model definitions, examples, and the detect.py script  


You‚Äôll find everything needed to clone, install, and run detection from live streams.


---

üìò Quickstart Guide

The quickstart instructions show how to get everything running fast:

1. Clone repository


2. Install dependencies


3. Run detect.py with your camera source  :



git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5
cd yolov5
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 detect.py --source http://<your-phone-ip>:8080/video --weights yolov5n.pt --conf 0.5

It's straightforward, and your object will be tracked live with bounding boxes.


---

üîç Confirmation

The presence of the detect.py script, the README, and pip-installable models confirm the repo‚Äôs integrity and availability  


---

‚úÖ What You Should Do Next

Run those commands above on your Pi (or laptop if Pi is too slow).

Use --source to point to your phone‚Äôs stream.

Test with your drone as it flies.


Let me know once you've cloned and tested it‚Äîwe'll build motion/LED trigger integration after that!
